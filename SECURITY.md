## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ImmoCalc Pro seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please report them by emailing the project maintainers directly or using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

3. To use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click on "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability and how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- **Status Update**: We will provide a more detailed response within 5 business days, indicating the next steps in handling your report.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of the initial report.

### What to Expect

- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue.
- We will keep you informed of our progress.
- Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- Authorized in accordance with any applicable anti-hacking laws
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service that would interfere with conducting security research

We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy.

Thank you for helping keep ImmoCalc Pro and our users safe!
